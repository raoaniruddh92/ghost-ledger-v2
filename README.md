- CTF organizers  
- Blockchain security learners  
- Anyone who likes breaking things (ethically)

## 🔥 What’s New in v2

### ⚙️ Automatic Contract Verification
No more manual sanity checks.

Ghostledger v2 automatically verifies deployed smart contracts against their expected source and bytecode.

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents broken or mismatched deployments
- Eliminates setup mistakes by challenge authors
- Improves trust in challenge integrity
- Speeds up challenge publishing

Deploy → verify → hack. That’s it.

---

### 💾 Local Storage Upgrades
State handling got a serious upgrade.

**Improvements:**
- Faster access to cached challenge data
- Reliable persistence across reloads
- Fewer unnecessary network calls
- Better tracking of user progress

Your session survives refreshes. Your progress doesn’t randomly vanish.

---

### ⚡ Faster UI
The UI has been optimized to stay out of your way.

**Under the hood:**
- Reduced load times
- More efficient state updates
- Smoother transitions
- Better performance with large challenge sets

Less waiting. More hacking.

### 🔔 On-Board Notifications *(WIP)*
Notification support is being wired in.

Planned alerts include:
- Challenge completion events
- Contract deployment & verification status
- Platform announcements
- Environment warnings

⚠️ This feature is **still under development** and will expand over time.

## 🧠 Why Ghostledger?
Ghostledger v2 is designed to scale from:
- Small local labs  
- Competitive CTF events  
- Blockchain security bootcamps  
- Self-hosted hacking environments  

The goal: **reduce platform friction so the focus stays on exploitation, learning, and creativity.**

---

## 🚧 Development Status
Ghostledger v2 is **actively developed**. Expect:
- Breaking changes
- New features
- UI and infra refinements

Feedback, bug reports, and PRs are welcome.
